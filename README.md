# Wine-Quality-Analysis

# Analysis
With regards to the wine industry, they would be glad if human quality of tasting would be nearly equal to the chemical properties of wine so that attestation and quality assessment and assurance process is more controlled.",
    "Data are gathered on 12 distinct attributes of the wines. one attribute is quality which is based on sensitive data, and the remaining are on chemical properties of the wines including density, acidity, alcohol content etc. Chemical attributes of wines are continuous variables. Quality is an ordinal variable with a possible ranking from 1 (bad) to 10 (good).
    
# Objectives    
    In this project, I develop a model that can explore a wine’s chemical properties to predict its quality. The wine quality dataset I’ll be using for this project consists of approximately 4898 observations, including 11 independent variables and one dependent variable,
    "The following models is taken to predict the quality of the wine:\n",
    "*Random Forest
    "*Stochastic Gradient Descent,
    "*Support Vector Classifier,
    "*Linear Regression,
    "*Logistic Regression,
    "*KNeighbor Classifier,
    "*Naive Bayes
